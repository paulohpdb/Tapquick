# Tapquick

A very basic game I did using React Native. It consists on clicking at the random red blocks the fastest you can in 1 minute. 

# The Rules:

<pre>Click on the red block = 1 point.
Click outside the red block = -10 points (or 0 if you had 10 or less).  </pre>

The game also saves your record
